# Applying-Classification-on-a-Dataset

Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well.

There are 2 types of Classification: 
1. Binomial
1. Multi-Class

Some of the key areas where classification cases are being used:
1. To find whether an email received is a spam or ham
2. To identify customer segments
3. To find if a bank loan is granted
4. To identify if a kid will pass or fail in an examination

Ex. Social media sentiment analysis has two potential outcomes, positive or negative, as displayed by the chart given below.
